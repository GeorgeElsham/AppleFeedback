# Apple Feedback

## What & why?
These are the feedbacks I'm filing to Apple, to document bugs I come across. The aim is that should you come across the same or a similar bug, you can read what I've documented about it. Some feedbacks may also provide workarounds to achieve the intended result.

## Feedbacks
- [FB13705098](FB13705098): Sheet background doesn't reach bottom when programmatically changing detent

## Contributing
Since this is a list of my feedbacks, please don't add entirely new feedbacks. However, if you have found a workaround not already mentioned, please create an issue with your working code. If the workaround makes use of external packages such as [SwiftUIIntrospect](https://github.com/siteline/swiftui-introspect), make that clear.
